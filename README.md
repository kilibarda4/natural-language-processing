# Natural Language Processing Repository

Welcome to my NLP Repository! This collection showcases various Natural Language Processing tasks, demonstrating fundamental techniques and models built from the ground up. It's aimed at anyone interested in understanding the inner workings of NLP models, from beginners to more experienced practitioners who wish to revisit the basics.

## Projects Overview

Below is a list of NLP tasks currently available in this repository. Each project is implemented from scratch, providing a deep dive into the algorithmic foundations of NLP. The repository is actively maintained, and more projects will be added over time.

### 1. Trigram Counter

A foundational tool for statistical language modeling, the Trigram Counter, analyzes a corpus to count the occurrences of trigram (three consecutive words). This is essential for understanding language patterns and can be the first step toward building more complex models like text predictors or grammar checkers.

### 2. Logistic Regression for Text Classification

Implementing Logistic Regression from scratch to perform text classification. This project demonstrates the application of a fundamental machine learning model to categorize text into predefined categories, showcasing how NLP can be used for sentiment analysis, topic labeling, and more.

### 3. Word Embedding

Dive into the world of word embeddings, where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers. This project covers the basics of creating embeddings from scratch, illustrating how semantic similarity and relationships can be captured in a dense vector space.

### 4. Neural Network from Scratch for NLP Tasks

Building a neural network from the ground up to predict personality types of the Myer Briggs dataset. This project is a deep dive into the components of neural networks, including how they are trained and how they can be applied to various NLP problems such as text classification, named entity recognition, and more.
